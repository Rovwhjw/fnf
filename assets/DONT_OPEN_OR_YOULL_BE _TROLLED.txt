"WELCOME MY FRIENDS"
       
Heya! 

If you're reading this, that means you obviously downloaded the mod, so thanks!Ig
And if you decided to follow the instructions and not click this, which you obviously didn't, good on you! You just missed
a bunch of important dialouge. Guess I did a little trolling

So like, you're probably wondering what this is for, am I right? No? Well you're gonna hear the reason anyway. It's a huge
credits section or whatever lol

Did you expect some secret file on game lore? Great! Did you know Denny's has a bar? Mr Trololo worked there and ended up
performing for the kids (JK That's not canon)

                           Saru: Person who made the song everyone keeps leaking- Why am I saying this?

                               Active: AYYY 1/3 charters, and the guy who made Prepare, and Evacuate hard.

                              Mr Amazing VA: Our other super pog VA who voiced the one and only Mr. Trololo
                     His VA-ing was epiccc, as you'll soon see, and I certainly hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
       
                         Audiospawn: He managed to voice Trollge- I didn't think it was possible until he showed up :o

              Fore: Pfft, our VA's weren't the only people that brought our story to life, it was the amazing Fore as well!
